| Key        | Action            |
|------------|-------------------|
| A / D      | Move left/right   |
| Down       | Soft drop         |
| Q / E      | Rotate left/right |
| Space      | Hard drop         |

Note: Arrow keys also move left/right in addition to A/D. Colors require a color-capable terminal (e.g., `xterm-256color`).
